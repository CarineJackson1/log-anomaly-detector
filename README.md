## 🔧 **Customize & Extend**

### **Easy Modifications:**
```python
# Add more suspicious words:
bad_words = [
    'failed', 'error', 'unauthorized', 'denied', 'blocked',
    'attack', 'intrusion', 'malware', 'virus', 'hack',
    'breach', 'exploit', 'phishing', 'ransomware'  # Add these!
]

# Change IP suspicion thresholds:
status = "🚨 VERY SUSPICIOUS" if count > 5 else "⚠️ Watch this one" if count > 2 else "✅ Normal"
```

### **Next Level Ideas:**
- 📅 **Add date/time analysis** to find attack patterns
