## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**. Instead, report it privately by following the steps below:

### 1. Contact
Email: **security@yourdomain.com**  
(Optional) For encrypted communication, PGP key: `https://yourdomain.com/pgp-key.asc`

### 2. What to Include
- A clear description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if possible)  
- Impact assessment (e.g., data exposure, execution privilege)  
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or payloads  
- Your contact preference for follow-up

### 3. Our Process
- **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**.  
- **Initial Triage:** We will assess severity and timeline within **5 business days**.  
- **Resolution:** We will work toward a fix or mitigation; you will be kept informed.  
- **Disclosure:** Coordinated public disclosure (if applicable) will be done after a fix is available, unless you request otherwise.  
- **Credit:** You can choose to be credited publicly for the finding.

## Severity Guidelines
We classify reported issues roughly as:
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, authentication bypass, data breach  
- **High:** Privilege escalation, significant denial of service  
- **Medium/Low:** Information leakage, minor misconfigurations  

## Safe Harbor
If you act in good faith to help improve security and follow this policy, you will not be subject to legal action.

## Contact Alternatives
If email is not possible, you may also use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting mechanism via the “Report a vulnerability” button in the repository’s Security tab.
