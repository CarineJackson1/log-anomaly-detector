## ðŸ”’ Security & Dependency Management

This repository uses an automated **SecDevOps workflow** to keep dependencies updated and secure.

### 1. Dependency Updates (Dependabot)
- **Frequency:** Weekly for Python (`pip`), JavaScript (`npm`), Docker, and GitHub Actions workflows.
- **Labels:** Each update PR gets:
  - `dependencies` (marks as a dependency update)
  - `auto-merge` (optional â€“ triggers automatic merging)
- **Reviewers:** Security leads (`@CarineJackson1`, `@sajanamhr21`) are auto-assigned for review.

### 2. Auto-Merge Rules
- Only **Dependabot PRs** with the `auto-merge` label will be merged automatically.
- Auto-merge happens **after** all required checks pass (build, tests, security scans).
- Major version updates **must be reviewed manually** before merging.

### 3. Security Scans
- **CodeQL Analysis** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)
  - Runs on every PR and weekly.
  - Detects vulnerabilities in JavaScript and Python code.
- **Snyk Scan** (`.github/workflows/snyk.yml`)
  - Runs on every PR and weekly.
  - Detects insecure dependencies in both JavaScript and Python.
  - Requires `SNYK_TOKEN` in repo secrets.

### 4. Branch Protection
- **`develop` branch:**
  - Requires passing build/tests, CodeQL, and Snyk before merging.
  - Requires PR reviews from code owners.
- **`main` branch:**
  - Changes can only come from `develop`.
  - Requires passing all security scans and build/tests before merging.
